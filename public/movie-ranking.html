<h2>My Favourite Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>Honestly, in my opinion this is the Greatest Movie of All time. 
    Beautiful animation, Amazing storytelling and heartfelt lessons about 
    facing your past head on that all people can follow. 
    As close as perfect as a movie can get for me.</p>
<h3>The Godfather Part 2</h3>
<p>This is is cinema in its purest form. It is iconic. A showcase of the ruthlessness of the patriarch of the corleone family. 
    This movie is a demonstration of how you build a compelling and complex villain.</p>
<h3>A silent Voice</h3>
<p>This Movie is so heartwarming. Learning how to not hate yourself. A beautiful love story. 
    All round amazing cinematography. 
    I absolutely love this movie I have nothing negative to say.</p>
