    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Kamohelo Khokho. Kamo for short. 
        I'm 22 years old and I'm from South Africa. 
        I went to an all boys school in Bloemfontein called Grey College. 
        I'm currently in North West University studying Human Movement Sciences and Sports Coaching. 
        I'm sure you're wondering why am I programming then if I'm already studying something that's
        so far away from computer science. The simple answer is I found it late. I honestly didn't think 
        it was something I could do. To be honest I still have moments like that, however I'm honestly having
        the best time with it. Pushing myself, learning a skill as difficult as coding. It's not an easy feat.
        Maybe that's why I've become so obsessed with it. It's such an amazing feeling when you solve
        a problem. Although the arrival of the problem makes me want to bang my head against the wall.
        I still have an obsession with improving my skills as a programmer.</p>
        <p>Apart from programming I'm a simple person. I love bodybuilding. Lifting weights is my most enjoyable
            hobby. I love video games. Like a lot. Maybe somewhere down the line I might get involved with
            game development. The world is literally my oyster. I'm just excited to see where my journey takes me.
        </p>
